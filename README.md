# Classification-Model-using-pattern-rule-mining.
This project's primary motivation is to build a classification model using the given dataset's patterns. Using the WEKA tool, we have generated the rules based on min_support_count and min_confidence value. Then accordingly, we have built the classification model, which would classify the data using these rules.
